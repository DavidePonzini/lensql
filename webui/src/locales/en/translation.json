Built with both students and teachers in mind, it supports a deeper understanding of relational databases by focusing on the reasoning behind queries — not just their correctness.",

The AI assistant, Lens, helps students reflect on their mistakes, refine their logic, and grow their skills with every attempt. Teachers, meanwhile, gain insight into how students learn, where they struggle, and how to support them effectively.",
