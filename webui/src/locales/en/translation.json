Built with both students and teachers in mind, it supports a deeper understanding of relational databases by focusing on the reasoning behind queries — not just their correctness.",
            "p2": "Instead of offering immediate solutions, LensQL encourages active exploration. The AI assistant, Lens, helps students reflect on their mistakes, refine their logic, and grow their skills with every attempt. Teachers, meanwhile, gain insight into how students learn, where they struggle, and how to support them effectively.",
            "p3": "Whether you're running your first query or refining complex joins, LensQL turns every error into an opportunity to learn.",
