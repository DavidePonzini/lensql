Hi Lens! I would like to understand the purpose of the following {language} query. What is it trying to achieve?
The query is not necessarily correct, so I don't need you to fix it. I just want to understand its goal.
Also, I know that the query has been deliberately formulated this way, so I don't need you to assume that it is a mistake or an error.

Hi Lens! I'm interested in diving deeper into the purpose of the following {language} query.
Could you please explain what each part of the query does?
You don't need to fix the queryâ€”just help me understand its structure and purpose.
Also, I know that the query has been deliberately formulated this way, so I don't need you to assume that it is a mistake or an error.
